roxy plays a shrewd trick
whoever has lived long enough to find out what life is knows how deep a debt of gratitude we owe to adam the first great benefactor of our race
he brought death into the world
percy driscoll slept well the night he saved his house-minions from going down the river but no wink of sleep visited roxy's eyes
a profound terror had taken possession of her
her child could grow up and be sold down the river
the thought crazed her with horror
if she dozed and lost herself for a moment the next moment she was on her feet flying to her child's cradle to see if it was still there
then she would gather it to her heart and pour out her love upon it in a frenzy of kisses moaning crying and saying
dey sha'n't oh dey sha'n't
yo' po' mammy will kill you fust
once when she was tucking it back in its cradle again the other child nestled in its sleep and attracted her attention
she went and stood over it a long time communing with herself
what has my po' baby done dat he couldn't have yo' luck
he hain't done noth'n'
god was good to you why warn't he good to him
dey can't sell you down de river
i hates yo' pappy he hain't got no heart for niggers he hain't anyways
i hates him en i could kill him
she paused awhile thinking then she burst into wild sobbings again and turned away saying
oh i got to kill my chile dey ain't no yuther way killin' him wouldn't save de chile fum goin' down de river
oh i got to do it yo' po' mammy's got to kill you to save you honey
she gathered her baby to her bosom now and began to smother it with caresses
mammy's got to kill you how kin i do it
but yo' mammy ain't gwine to desert you no no dah don't cry she gwine wid you she gwine to kill herself too
come along honey come along wid mammy we gwine to jump in de river den de troubles o' dis worl' is all over dey don't sell po' niggers down the river over yonder
she started toward the door crooning to the child and hushing it midway she stopped suddenly
she had caught sight of her new sunday gown a cheap curtain-calico thing a conflagration of gaudy colors and fantastic figures
she surveyed it wistfully longingly
hain't ever wore it yet
en it's jist lovely
then she nodded her head in response to a pleasant idea and added
no i ain't gwine to be fished out wid everybody lookin' at me in dis mis'able ole linsey-woolsey
she put down the child and made the change
she looked in the glass and was astonished at her beauty
she resolved to make her death-toilet perfect
she took off her handkerchief-turban and dressed her glossy wealth of hair
she added some odds and ends of rather lurid ribbon and a spray of atrocious artificial flowers finally she threw over her shoulders a fluffy thing called a
in that day which was of a blazing red complexion
then she was ready for the tomb
she gathered up her baby once more but when her eye fell upon its miserably short little gray tow-linen shirt and noted the contrast between its pauper shabbiness and her own volcanic irruption of infernal splendors her mother-heart was touched and she was ashamed
no dolling mammy ain't gwine to treat you so
de angels is gwine to 'mire you jist as much as dey does yo' mammy
ain't gwine to have 'em putt'n' dey han's up 'fo' dey eyes en sayin' to david en goliah en dem yuther prophets 'dat chile is dress' too indelicate fo' dis place
by this time she had stripped off the shirt
now she clothed the naked little creature in one of thomas à becket's snowy long baby-gowns with its bright blue bows and dainty flummery of ruffles
dah now you's fixed
she propped the child in a chair and stood off to inspect it
straightway her eyes began to widen with astonishment and admiration and she clapped her hands and cried out
why it do beat all
i never knowed you was so lovely
marse tommy ain't a bit puttier not a single bit
she stepped over and glanced at the other infant she flung a glance back at her own then one more at the heir of the house
now a strange light dawned in her eyes and in a moment she was lost in thought
she seemed in a trance when she came out of it she muttered
when i 'uz a-washin' 'em in de tub yistiddy his own pappy asked me which of 'em was his'n
she began to move about like one in a dream
she undressed thomas à becket stripping him of everything and put the tow-linen shirt on him
she put his coral necklace on her own child's neck
then she placed the children side by side and after earnest inspection she muttered
now who would b'lieve clo'es could do de like o' dat
dog my cats if it ain't all i kin do to tell t'other fum which let alone his pappy
she put her cub in tommy's elegant cradle and said
you's young marse tom fum dis out en i got to practise and git used to 'memberin' to call you dat honey or i's gwine to make a mistake some time en git us bofe into trouble
dah now you lay still en don't fret no mo' marse tom oh thank de good lord in heaven you's saved you's saved
dey ain't no man kin ever sell mammy's po' little honey down de river now
she put the heir of the house in her own child's unpainted pine cradle and said contemplating its slumbering form uneasily
i's sorry for you honey i's sorry god knows i is but what kin i do what could i do
yo' pappy would sell him to somebody some time en den he'd go down de river sho' en i couldn't couldn't couldn't stan' it
she flung herself on her bed and began to think and toss toss and think
by and by she sat suddenly upright for a comforting thought had flown through her worried mind
'tain't no sin white folks has done it
it ain't no sin glory to goodness it ain't no sin
dey's done it yes en dey was de biggest quality in de whole bilin' too kings
she began to muse she was trying to gather out of her memory the dim particulars of some tale she had heard some time or other
at last she said
now i's got it now i 'member
it was dat ole nigger preacher dat tole it de time he come over here fum illinois en preached in de nigger church
he said dey ain't nobody kin save his own self can't do it by faith can't do it by works can't do it no way at all
free grace is de on'y way en dat don't come fum nobody but jis' de lord en he kin give it to anybody he please saint or sinner he don't kyer
he do jis' as he's a mineter
he s'lect out anybody dat suit him en put another one in his place and make de fust one happy forever en leave t'other one to burn wid satan
de preacher said it was jist like dey done in englan' one time long time ago
de queen she lef' her baby layin' aroun' one day en went out callin' en one o' de niggers roun'-'bout de place dat was 'mos' white she come in en see de chile layin' aroun' en tuck en put her own chile's clo'es on de queen's chile en put de queen's chile's clo'es on her own chile en den lef' her own chile layin' aroun' en tuck en toted de queen's chile home to de nigger-quarter en nobody ever foun' it out en her chile was de king bimeby en sole de queen's chile down de river one time when dey had to settle up de estate
dah now de preacher said it his own self en it ain't no sin 'ca'se white folks done it
dey done it yes dey done it en not on'y jis' common white folks nuther but de biggest quality dey is in de whole bilin'
oh i's so glad i 'member 'bout dat
she got up light-hearted and happy and went to the cradles and spent what was left of the night
she would give her own child a light pat and say humbly
lay still marse tom
then give the real tom a pat and say with severity
does you want me to take somep'n' to you
as she progressed with her practice she was surprised to see how steadily and surely the awe which had kept her tongue reverent and her manner humble toward her young master was transferring itself to her speech and manner toward the usurper and how similarly handy she was becoming in transferring her motherly curtness of speech and peremptoriness of manner to the unlucky heir of the ancient house of driscoll
she took occasional rests from practising and absorbed herself in calculating her chances
dey'll sell dese niggers to-day fo' stealin' de money den dey'll buy some mo' dat don't know de chillen so dat's all right
when i takes de chillen out to git de air de minute i's roun' de corner i's gwine to gaum dey mouths all roun' wid jam den dey can't nobody notice dey's changed
yes i gwineter do dat till i's safe if it's a year
dey ain't but one man dat i's afeard of en dat's dat pudd'nhead wilson
dey calls him a pudd'nhead en says he's a fool
my lan' dat man ain't no mo' fool den i is
he's de smartes' man in dis town less'n it's jedge driscoll or maybe pem howard
blame dat man he worries me wid dem ornery glasses o' hisn i b'lieve he's a witch
but nemmine i's gwine to happen aroun' dah one o' dese days en let on dat i reckon he wants to print de chillen's fingers ag'in en if he don't notice dey's changed i bound dey ain't nobody gwine to notice it en den i's safe sho'
but i reckon i'll tote along a hoss-shoe to keep off de witch-work
the new negroes gave roxy no trouble of course
the master gave her none for one of his speculations was in jeopardy and his mind was so occupied that he hardly saw the children when he looked at them and all roxy had to do was to get them both into a gale of laughter when he came about then their faces were mainly cavities exposing gums and he was gone again before the spasm passed and the little creatures resumed a human aspect
within a few days the fate of the speculation became so dubious that mr
percy went away with his brother the judge to see what could be done with it
it was a land speculation as usual and it had gotten complicated with a lawsuit
the men were gone seven weeks
before they got back roxy had paid her visit to wilson and was satisfied
wilson took the finger-prints labeled them with the names and with the date october the first put them carefully away and continued his chat with roxy who seemed very anxious that he should admire the great advance in flesh and beauty which the babies had made since he took their finger-prints a month before
he complimented their improvement to her contentment and as they were without any disguise of jam or other stain she trembled all the while and was miserably frightened lest at any moment he but he didn't
he discovered nothing and she went home jubilant and dropped all concern about the matter permanently out of her mind
the ways of the changelings
adam and eve had many advantages but the principal one was that they escaped teething
there is this trouble about special providences namely there is so often a doubt as to which party was intended to be the beneficiary
in the case of the children the bears and the prophet the bears got more real satisfaction out of the episode than the prophet did because they got the children
this history must henceforth accommodate itself to the change which roxana has consummated and call the real heir
and the usurping little slave
shortening this latter name to
for daily use as the people about him did
was a bad baby from the very beginning of his usurpation
he would cry for nothing he would burst into storms of devilish temper without notice and let go scream after scream and squall after squall then climax the thing with
that frightful specialty of the teething nursling in the throes of which the creature exhausts its lungs then is convulsed with noiseless squirmings and twistings and kickings in the effort to get its breath while the lips turn blue and the mouth stands wide and rigid offering for inspection one wee tooth set in the lower rim of a hoop of red gums and when the appalling stillness has endured until one is sure the lost breath will never return a nurse comes flying and dashes water in the child's face and presto
the lungs fill and instantly discharge a shriek or a yell or a howl which bursts the listening ear and surprises the owner of it into saying words which would not go well with a halo if he had one
the baby tom would claw anybody who came within reach of his nails and pound anybody he could reach with his rattle
he would scream for water until he got it and then throw cup and all on the floor and scream for more
he was indulged in all his caprices howsoever troublesome and exasperating they might be he was allowed to eat anything he wanted particularly things that would give him the stomach-ache
when he got to be old enough to begin to toddle about and say broken words and get an idea of what his hands were for he was a more consummate pest than ever
roxy got no rest while he was awake
he would call for anything and everything he saw simply saying
want it which was a command
when it was brought he said in a frenzy and motioning it away with his hands
and the moment it was gone he set up frantic yells of
and roxy had to give wings to her heels to get that thing back to him again before he could get time to carry out his intention of going into convulsions about it
what he preferred above all other things was the tongs
this was because his
had forbidden him to have them lest he break windows and furniture with them
the moment roxy's back was turned he would toddle to the presence of the tongs and say
and cock his eye to one side to see if roxy was observing then
and cock his eye again then
with another furtive glance and finally
and the prize was his
the next moment the heavy implement was raised aloft the next there was a crash and a squall and the cat was off on three legs to meet an engagement roxy would arrive just as the lamp or a window went to irremediable smash
tom got all the petting chambers got none
tom got all the delicacies chambers got mush and milk and clabber without sugar
in consequence tom was a sickly child and chambers wasn't
as roxy called it and overbearing chambers was meek and docile
with all her splendid common sense and practical every-day ability roxy was a doting fool of a mother
she was this toward her child and she was also more than this by the fiction created by herself he was become her master the necessity of recognizing this relation outwardly and of perfecting herself in the forms required to express the recognition had moved her to such diligence and faithfulness in practicing these forms that this exercise soon concreted itself into habit it became automatic and unconscious then a natural result followed deceptions intended solely for others gradually grew practically into self-deceptions as well the mock reverence became real reverence the mock obsequiousness real obsequiousness the mock homage real homage the little counterfeit rift of separation between imitation-slave and imitation-master widened and widened and became an abyss and a very real one and on one side of it stood roxy the dupe of her own deceptions and on the other stood her child no longer a usurper to her but her accepted and recognized master
he was her darling her master and her deity all in one and in her worship of him she forgot who she was and what he had been
in babyhood tom cuffed and banged and scratched chambers unrebuked and chambers early learned that between meekly bearing it and resenting it the advantage all lay with the former policy
the few times that his persecutions had moved him beyond control and made him fight back had cost him very dear at headquarters not at the hands of roxy for if she ever went beyond scolding him sharply for
forgitt'n' who his young marster was
she at least never extended her punishment beyond a box on the ear
no percy driscoll was the person
he told chambers that under no provocation whatever was he privileged to lift his hand against his little master
chambers overstepped the line three times and got three such convincing canings from the man who was his father and didn't know it that he took tom's cruelties in all humility after that and made no more experiments
outside of the house the two boys were together all through their boyhood
chambers was strong beyond his years and a good fighter strong because he was coarsely fed and hard worked about the house and a good fighter because tom furnished him plenty of practice on white boys whom he hated and was afraid of
chambers was his constant body-guard to and from school he was present on the playground at recess to protect his charge
he fought himself into such a formidable reputation by and by that tom could have changed clothes with him and
like sir kay in launcelot's armor
he was good at games of skill too
tom staked him with marbles to play
with and then took all the winnings away from him
in the winter season chambers was on hand in tom's worn-out clothes with
at the knees and seat to drag a sled up the hill for tom warmly clad to ride down on but he never got a ride himself
he built snow men and snow fortifications under tom's directions
he was tom's patient target when tom wanted to do some snowballing but the target couldn't fire back
chambers carried tom's skates to the river and strapped them on him then trotted around after him on the ice so as to be on hand when wanted but he wasn't ever asked to try the skates himself
in summer the pet pastime of the boys of dawson's landing was to steal apples peaches and melons from the farmers' fruit-wagons mainly on account of the risk they ran of getting their heads laid open with the butt of the farmer's whip
tom was a distinguished adept at these thefts by proxy
chambers did his stealing and got the peach-stones apple-cores and melon-rinds for his share
tom always made chambers go in swimming with him and stay by him as a protection
when tom had had enough he would slip out and tie knots in chambers's shirt dip the knots in the water and make them hard to undo then dress himself and sit by and laugh while the naked shiverer tugged at the stubborn knots with his teeth
tom did his humble comrade these various ill turns partly out of native viciousness and partly because he hated him for his superiorities of physique and pluck and for his manifold cleverness
tom couldn't dive for it gave him splitting headaches
chambers could dive without inconvenience and was fond of doing it
he excited so much admiration one day among a crowd of white boys by throwing back somersaults from the stern of a canoe that it wearied tom's spirit and at last he shoved the canoe underneath chambers while he was in the air so he came down on his head in the canoe-bottom and while he lay unconscious several of tom's ancient adversaries saw that their long-desired opportunity was come and they gave the false heir such a drubbing that with chambers's best help he was hardly able to drag himself home afterward
when the boys were fifteen and upward tom was
in the river one day when he was taken with a cramp and shouted for help
it was a common trick with the boys particularly if a stranger was present to pretend a cramp and howl for help then when the stranger came tearing hand over hand to the rescue the howler would go on struggling and howling till he was close at hand then replace the howl with a sarcastic smile and swim blandly away while the town boys assailed the dupe with a volley of jeers and laughter
tom had never tried this joke as yet but was supposed to be trying it now so the boys held warily back but chambers believed his master was in earnest therefore he swam out and arrived in time unfortunately and saved his life
this was the last feather
tom had managed to endure everything else but to have to remain publicly and permanently under such an obligation as this to a nigger and to this nigger of all niggers this was too much
he heaped insults upon chambers for
to think he was in earnest in calling for help and said that anybody but a block-headed nigger would have known he was funning and left him alone
tom's enemies were in strong force here so they came out with their opinions quite freely
they laughed at him and called him coward liar sneak and other sorts of pet names and told him they meant to call chambers by a new name after this and make it common in the town
to signify that he had had a second birth into this life and that chambers was the author of his new being
tom grew frantic under these taunts and shouted
knock their heads off chambers
knock their heads off
what do you stand there with your hands in your pockets for
chambers expostulated and said
but marse tom dey's too many of 'em dey's
do you hear me
please marse tom don't make me
dey's so many of 'em dat
tom sprang at him and drove his pocket-knife into him two or three times before the boys could snatch him away and give the wounded lad a chance to escape
he was considerably hurt but not seriously
if the blade had been a little longer his career would have ended there
tom had long ago taught roxy
it had been many a day now since she had ventured a caress or a fondling epithet in his quarter
such things from a
were repulsive to him and she had been warned to keep her distance and remember who she was
she saw her darling gradually cease from being her son she saw that detail perish utterly all that was left was master master pure and simple and it was not a gentle mastership either
she saw herself sink from the sublime height of motherhood to the somber depths of unmodified slavery
the abyss of separation between her and her boy was complete
she was merely his chattel now his convenience his dog his cringing and helpless slave the humble and unresisting victim of his capricious temper and vicious nature
sometimes she could not go to sleep even when worn out with fatigue because her rage boiled so high over the day's experiences with her boy
she would mumble and mutter to herself
he struck me en i warn't no way to blame struck me in de face right before folks
en he's al'ays callin' me nigger-wench en hussy en all dem mean names when i's doin' de very bes' i kin
oh lord i done so much for him i lift' him away up to what he is en dis is what i git for it
sometimes when some outrage of peculiar offensiveness stung her to the heart she would plan schemes of vengeance and revel in the fancied spectacle of his exposure to the world as an imposter and a slave but in the midst of these joys fear would strike her she had made him too strong she could prove nothing and heavens she might get sold down the river for her pains
so her schemes always went for nothing and she laid them aside in impotent rage against the fates and against herself for playing the fool on that fatal september day in not providing herself with a witness for use in the day when such a thing might be needed for the appeasing of her vengeance-hungry heart
and yet the moment tom happened to be good to her and kind and this occurred every now and then all her sore places were healed and she was happy happy and proud for this was her son her nigger son lording it among the whites and securely avenging their crimes against her race
there were two grand funerals in dawson's landing that fall the fall of 1845
one was that of colonel cecil burleigh essex the other that of percy driscoll
on his death-bed driscoll set roxy free and delivered his idolized ostensible son solemnly into the keeping of his brother the judge and his wife
those childless people were glad to get him
childless people are not difficult to please
judge driscoll had gone privately to his brother a month before and bought chambers
he had heard that tom had been trying to get his father to sell the boy down the river and he wanted to prevent the scandal for public sentiment did not approve of that way of treating family servants for light cause or for no cause
percy driscoll had worn himself out in trying to save his great speculative landed estate and had died without succeeding
he was hardly in his grave before the boom collapsed and left his hitherto envied young devil of an heir a pauper
but that was nothing his uncle told him he should be his heir and have all his fortune when he died so tom was comforted
roxy had no home now so she resolved to go around and say good-by to her friends and then clear out and see the world that is to say she would go chambermaiding on a steamboat the darling ambition of her race and sex
her last call was on the black giant jasper
she found him chopping pudd'nhead wilson's winter provision of wood
wilson was chatting with him when roxy arrived
he asked her how she could bear to go off chambermaiding and leave her boys and chaffingly offered to copy off a series of their finger-prints reaching up to their twelfth year for her to remember them by but she sobered in a moment wondering if he suspected anything then she said she believed she didn't want them
wilson said to himself
the drop of black blood in her is superstitious she thinks there's some devilry some witch-business about my glass mystery somewhere she used to come here with an old horseshoe in her hand it could have been an accident but i doubt it
