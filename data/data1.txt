pudd'nhead wins his name
tell the truth or trump but get the trick
the scene of this chronicle is the town of dawson's landing on the missouri side of the mississippi half a day's journey per steamboat below st
in 1830 it was a snug little collection of modest one- and two-story frame dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from sight by climbing tangles of rose-vines honeysuckles and morning-glories
each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks marigolds touch-me-nots prince's-feathers and other old-fashioned flowers while on the window-sills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing moss-rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame
when there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat the cat was there in sunny weather stretched at full length asleep and blissful with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose
then that house was complete and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol whose testimony is infallible
a home without a cat and a well-fed well-petted and properly revered cat may be a perfect home perhaps but how can it prove title
all along the streets on both sides at the outer edge of the brick sidewalks stood locust-trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing and these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrance in spring when the clusters of buds came forth
the main street one block back from the river and running parallel with it was the sole business street
it was six blocks long and in each block two or three brick stores three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little frame shops
swinging signs creaked in the wind the street's whole length
the candy-striped pole which indicates nobility proud and ancient along the palace-bordered canals of venice indicated merely the humble barber shop along the main street of dawson's landing
on a chief corner stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin pots and pans and cups the chief tinmonger's noisy notice to the world when the wind blew that his shop was on hand for business at that corner
the hamlet's front was washed by the clear waters of the great river its body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline its most rearward border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about the base-line of the hills the hills rose high inclosing the town in a half-moon curve clothed with forests from foot to summit
steamboats passed up and down every hour or so
those belonging to the little cairo line and the little memphis line always stopped the big orleans liners stopped for hails only or to land passengers or freight and this was the case also with the great flotilla of
these latter came out of a dozen rivers the illinois the missouri the upper mississippi the ohio the monongahela the tennessee the red river the white river and so on and were bound every whither and stocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity which the mississippi's communities could want from the frosty falls of st
anthony down through nine climates to torrid new orleans
dawson's landing was a slaveholding town with a rich slave-worked grain and pork country back of it
the town was sleepy and comfortable and contented
it was fifty years old and was growing slowly very slowly in fact but still it was growing
the chief citizen was york leicester driscoll about forty years old judge of the county court
he was very proud of his old virginian ancestry and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately manners he kept up its traditions
he was fine and just and generous
to be a gentleman a gentleman without stain or blemish was his only religion and to it he was always faithful
he was respected esteemed and beloved by all the community
he was well off and was gradually adding to his store
he and his wife were very nearly happy but not quite for they had no children
the longing for the treasure of a child had grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away but the blessing never came and was never to come
with this pair lived the judge's widowed sister mrs
rachel pratt and she also was childless childless and sorrowful for that reason and not to be comforted
the women were good and commonplace people and did their duty and had their reward in clear consciences and the community's approbation
they were presbyterians the judge was a free-thinker
pembroke howard lawyer and bachelor aged about forty was another old virginian grandee with proved descent from the first families
he was a fine brave majestic creature a gentleman according to the nicest requirements of the virginia rule a devoted presbyterian an authority on the
and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious to you and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from brad-awls to artillery
he was very popular with the people and was the judge's dearest friend
then there was colonel cecil burleigh essex another f
of formidable caliber however with him we have no concern
percy northumberland driscoll brother to the judge and younger than he by five years was a married man and had had children around his hearthstone but they were attacked in detail by measles croup and scarlet fever and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective antediluvian methods so the cradles were empty
he was a prosperous man with a good head for speculations and his fortune was growing
on the 1st of february 1830 two boy babes were born in his house one to him the other to one of his slave girls roxana by name
roxana was twenty years old
she was up and around the same day with her hands full for she was tending both babies
percy driscoll died within the week
roxy remained in charge of the children
she had her own way for mr
driscoll soon absorbed himself in his speculations and left her to her own devices
in that same month of february dawson's landing gained a new citizen
david wilson a young fellow of scotch parentage
he had wandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of the state of new york to seek his fortune
he was twenty-five years old college-bred and had finished a post-college course in an eastern law school a couple of years before
he was a homely freckled sandy-haired young fellow with an intelligent blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a covert twinkle of a pleasant sort
but for an unfortunate remark of his he would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at dawson's landing
but he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in the village and it
he had just made the acquaintance of a group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable whereupon young wilson said much as one who is thinking aloud
i wish i owned half of that dog
because i would kill my half
the group searched his face with curiosity with anxiety even but found no light there no expression that they could read
they fell away from him as from something uncanny and went into privacy to discuss him
'pears to be a fool
is i reckon you better say
said he wished he owned half of the dog the idiot
what did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his half
do you reckon he thought it would live
why he must have thought it unless he is the downrightest fool in the world because if he hadn't thought it he would have wanted to own the whole dog knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died he would be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed that half instead of his own
don't it look that way to you gents
if he owned one half of the general dog it would be so if he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end it would be so just the same particularly in the first case because if you kill one half of a general dog there are not any man that can tell whose half it was but if he owned one end of the dog maybe he could kill his end of it and
no he couldn't either he couldn't and not be responsible if the other end died which it would
in my opinion that man are not in his right mind
in my opinion he hare not got any mind
well he's a lummox anyway
that's what he is
he's a labrick just a simon-pure labrick if ever there was one
yes sir he's a dam fool that's the way i put him up
anybody can think different that wants to but those are my sentiments
i am with you gentlemen
perfect jackass yes and it are not going too far to say he is a pudd'nhead
if he are not a pudd'nhead i are not no judge that's all
the incident was told all over the town and gravely discussed by everybody
within a week he had lost his first name pudd'nhead took its place
in time he came to be liked and well liked too but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on and it stayed
that first day's verdict made him a fool and he was not able to get it set aside or even modified
the nickname soon ceased to carry any harsh or unfriendly feeling with it but it held its place and was to continue to hold its place for twenty long years
driscoll spares his slaves
adam was but human this explains it all
he did not want the apple for the apple's sake he wanted it only because it was forbidden
the mistake was in not forbidding the serpent then he would have eaten the serpent
pudd'nhead wilson had a trifle of money when he arrived and he bought a small house on the extreme western verge of the town
between it and judge driscoll's house there was only a grassy yard with a paling fence dividing the properties in the middle
he hired a small office down in the town and hung out a tin sign with these words on it david wilson
but his deadly remark had ruined his chance at least in the law
he took down his sign after a while and put it up on his own house with the law features knocked out of it
it offered his services now in the humble capacities of land-surveyor and expert accountant
now and then he got a job of surveying to do and now and then a merchant got him to straighten out his books
with scotch patience and pluck he resolved to live down his reputation and work his way into the legal field yet
poor fellow he could not foresee that it was going to take him such a weary long time to do it
he had a rich abundance of idle time but it never hung heavy on his hands for he interested himself in every new thing that was born into the universe of ideas and studied it and experimented upon it at his house
one of his pet fads was palmistry
to another one he gave no name neither would he explain to anybody what its purpose was but merely said it was an amusement
in fact he had found that his fads added to his reputation as a pudd'nhead therefore he was growing chary of being too communicative about them
the fad without a name was one which dealt with people's finger-marks
he carried in his coat pocket a shallow box with grooves in it and in the grooves strips of glass five inches long and three inches wide
along the lower edge of each strip was pasted a slip of white paper
he asked people to pass their hands through their hair thus collecting upon them a thin coating of the natural oil and then make a thumb-mark on a glass strip following it with the mark of the ball of each finger in succession
under this row of faint grease-prints he would write a record on the strip of white paper thus john smith right hand and add the day of the month and the year then take smith's left hand on another glass strip and add name and date and the words
the strips were now returned to the grooved box and took their place among what wilson called his
he often studied his records examining and poring over them with absorbing interest until far into the night but what he found there if he found anything he revealed to no one
sometimes he copied on paper the involved and delicate pattern left by the ball of a finger and then vastly enlarged it with a pantograph so that he could examine its web of curving lines with ease and convenience
one sweltering afternoon it was the first day of july 1830 he was at work over a set of tangled account-books in his work-room which looked westward over a stretch of vacant lots when a conversation outside disturbed him
it was carried on in yells which showed that the people engaged in it were not close together
say roxy how does yo' baby come on
this from the distant voice
fust-rate how does you come on jasper
this yell was from close by
oh i's middlin' hare not got noth'n' to complain of
i's gwine to come a-court'n' you bimeby roxy
you is you black mud-cat
i got somep'n' better to do den 'sociat'n' wid niggers as black as you is
is ole miss cooper's nancy done give you de mitten
roxy followed this sally with another discharge of care-free laughter
you's jealous roxy dat's what's de matter wid you you hussy yah yah yah
dat's de time i got you
oh yes you got me hare not you
'clah to goodness if dat conceit o' yo'n strikes in jasper it gwine to kill you sho'
if you b'longed to me i'd sell you down de river 'fo' you git too fur gone
fust time i runs acrost yo' marster i's gwine to tell him so
this idle and aimless jabber went on and on both parties enjoying the friendly duel and each well satisfied with his own share of the wit exchanged for wit they considered it
wilson stepped to the window to observe the combatants he could not work while their chatter continued
over in the vacant lots was jasper young coal-black and of magnificent build sitting on a wheelbarrow in the pelting sun at work supposably whereas he was in fact only preparing for it by taking an hour's rest before beginning
in front of wilson's porch stood roxy with a local hand-made baby-wagon in which sat her two charges one at each end and facing each other
from roxy's manner of speech a stranger would have expected her to be black but she was not
only one sixteenth of her was black and that sixteenth did not show
she was of majestic form and stature her attitudes were imposing and statuesque and her gestures and movements distinguished by a noble and stately grace
her complexion was very fair with the rosy glow of vigorous health in the cheeks her face was full of character and expression her eyes were brown and liquid and she had a heavy suit of fine soft hair which was also brown but the fact was not apparent because her head was bound about with a checkered handkerchief and the hair was concealed under it
her face was shapely intelligent and comely even beautiful
she had an easy independent carriage when she was among her own caste and a high and
way withal but of course she was meek and humble enough where white people were
to all intents and purposes roxy was as white as anybody but the one sixteenth of her which was black outvoted the other fifteen parts and made her a negro
she was a slave and salable as such
her child was thirty-one parts white and he too was a slave and by a fiction of law and custom a negro
he had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white comrade but even the father of the white child was able to tell the children apart little as he had commerce with them by their clothes for the white babe wore ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace while the other wore merely a coarse tow-linen shirt which barely reached to its knees and no jewelry
the white child's name was thomas à becket driscoll the other's name was valet de chambre no surname slaves hadn't the privilege
roxana had heard that phrase somewhere the fine sound of it had pleased her ear and as she had supposed it was a name she loaded it on to her darling
it soon got shorted to
wilson knew roxy by sight and when the duel of wit began to play out he stepped outside to gather in a record or two
jasper went to work energetically at once perceiving that his leisure was observed
wilson inspected the children and asked
how old are they roxy
bofe de same age sir five months
bawn de fust o' feb'uary
they are handsome little chaps
one's just as handsome as the other too
a delighted smile exposed the girl's white teeth and she said
bless yo' soul misto wilson it's pow'ful nice o' you to say dat 'ca'se one of 'em are not on'y a nigger
mighty prime little nigger i al'ays says but dat's 'ca'se it's mine o' course
how do you tell them apart roxy when they haven't any clothes on
roxy laughed a laugh proportioned to her size and said
oh i kin tell 'em 'part misto wilson but i bet marse percy couldn't not to save his life
wilson chatted along for awhile and presently got roxy's finger-prints for his collection right hand and left on a couple of his glass strips then labeled and dated them and took the
of both children and labeled and dated them also
two months later on the 3d of september he took this trio of finger-marks again
he liked to have a
at intervals during the period of childhood these to be followed by others at intervals of several years
the next day that is to say on the 4th of september something occurred which profoundly impressed roxana
driscoll missed another small sum of money which is a way of saying that this was not a new thing but had happened before
in truth it had happened three times before
driscoll's patience was exhausted
he was a fairly humane man toward slaves and other animals he was an exceedingly humane man toward the erring of his own race
theft he could not abide and plainly there was a thief in his house
necessarily the thief must be one of his negroes
sharp measures must be taken
he called his servants before him
there were three of these besides roxy a man a woman and a boy twelve years old
they were not related
you have all been warned before
it has done no good
this time i will teach you a lesson
i will sell the thief
which of you is the guilty one
they all shuddered at the threat for here they had a good home and a new one was likely to be a change for the worse
the denial was general
none had stolen anything not money anyway a little sugar or cake or honey or something like that that
marse percy wouldn't mind or miss
but not money never a cent of money
they were eloquent in their protestations but mr
driscoll was not moved by them
he answered each in turn with a stern
the truth was all were guilty but roxana she suspected that the others were guilty but she did not know them to be so
she was horrified to think how near she had come to being guilty herself she had been saved in the nick of time by a revival in the colored methodist church a fortnight before at which time and place she
the very next day after that gracious experience while her change of style was fresh upon her and she was vain of her purified condition her master left a couple dollars lying unprotected on his desk and she happened upon that temptation when she was polishing around with a dust-rag
she looked at the money awhile with a steady rising resentment then she burst out with
dad blame dat revival i wisht it had 'a' be'n put off till to-morrow
then she covered the tempter with a book and another member of the kitchen cabinet got it
she made this sacrifice as a matter of religious etiquette as a thing necessary just now but by no means to be wrested into a precedent no a week or two would limber up her piety then she would be rational again and the next two dollars that got left out in the cold would find a comforter and she could name the comforter
was she worse than the general run of her race
they had an unfair show in the battle of life and they held it no sin to take military advantage of the enemy in a small way in a small way but not in a large one
they would smouch provisions from the pantry whenever they got a chance or a brass thimble or a cake of wax or an emery-bag or a paper of needles or a silver spoon or a dollar bill or small articles of clothing or any other property of light value and so far were they from considering such reprisals sinful that they would go to church and shout and pray the loudest and sincerest with their plunder in their pockets
a farm smoke-house had to be kept heavily padlocked for even the colored deacon himself could not resist a ham when providence showed him in a dream or otherwise where such a thing hung lonesome and longed for some one to love
but with a hundred hanging before him the deacon would not take two that is on the same night
on frosty nights the humane negro prowler would warm the end of a plank and put it up under the cold claws of chickens roosting in a tree a drowsy hen would step on to the comfortable board softly clucking her gratitude and the prowler would dump her into his bag and later into his stomach perfectly sure that in taking this trifle from the man who daily robbed him of an inestimable treasure his liberty he was not committing any sin that god would remember against him in the last great day
for the fourth time mr
driscoll had said it and always in the same hard tone
and now he added these words of awful import
i give you one minute
he took out his watch
if at the end of that time you have not confessed i will not only sell all four of you but i will sell you down the river
it was equivalent to condemning them to hell
no missouri negro doubted this
roxy reeled in her tracks and the color vanished out of her face the others dropped to their knees as if they had been shot tears gushed from their eyes their supplicating hands went up and three answers came in the one instant
have mercy marster lord have mercy on us po' niggers
said the master putting up his watch
i will sell you here though you don't deserve it
you ought to be sold down the river
the culprits flung themselves prone in an ecstasy of gratitude and kissed his feet declaring that they would never forget his goodness and never cease to pray for him as long as they lived
they were sincere for like a god he had stretched forth his mighty hand and closed the gates of hell against them
he knew himself that he had done a noble and gracious thing and was privately well pleased with his magnanimity and that night he set the incident down in his diary so that his son might read it in after years and be thereby moved to deeds of gentleness and humanity himself
